By using the Service, you acknowledge that the Service is a temporary, free trial version made available to a select group of users that shall only be used for internal, experimental use. Dune does not warrant that the Service will meet any requirements for functionality whatsoever. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranty or condition of any kind either expressed or implied.

Dune retains all rights to all elements of the Service including all copyright and any other intellectual property rights. Users do not receive any license or usage rights to the Service beyond what is explicitly stated in these Terms.

Continued use of the Service beyond the agreed trial period will be conditional upon you signing up as a user on the applicable terms for Dune’s paid API service.  Dune reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will notify you prior to any new terms taking effect.
