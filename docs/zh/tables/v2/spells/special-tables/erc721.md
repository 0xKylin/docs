# ERC721

### **ERC721定义**

The ERC721 standard is the token standard that is used for non-fungible assets on all EVM blockchains. ERC721s can represent digital art, a deed to a house, an insurance policy or even a uniswap V3 liquidity position. The shared property of all these things is that they are not fungible and therefore unique.

ERC721 tokens are uniquely identified by a combination of `contract_address` and `tokenId`.

There only ever can exist one of each `tokenId` within each smart contract. an optional feature of the interface is a `tokenURI` property in which the associated media content of the `tokenId` within this smart contract is stored. This mostly is links to decentralized storage solutions like [ifps](https://ipfs.io).

The standard contains many functions similar to ERC20 tokens as it was influenced by it, but does expand on the functionality \*\*\*\* due to the added complexity regarding `tokenId`.

ERC721代币标准是用于所有EVM区块链上的非同质化资产的代币标准。ERC721可以代表数字艺术、房屋契约、保险单，甚至是uniswap V3流动性头寸。所有这些事物的共同属性是它们是非同质化的，因此也是独一无二的。

ERC721代币将 `contract_address` 和 `tokenId` 的作为唯一标识。

每个智能合约中同一个“tokenId”只能出现1次。该接口的一个可选功能是“tokenURI”属性，这里边存储了该智能合约中“tokenId”相关的多媒体内容。 这主要是指向去中心化存储解决方案的链接，例如 [ifps](https://ipfs.io)。

因为也是受了ERC20代币标准的影响，ERC721标准中也包含许多与之类似的功能，但由于增加了 `tokenId` 的复杂性，它也确实扩展了其他功能 \*\*\*\*。

**Methods**

```solidity
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256); 
    /* returns the amount of tokens a certain address(_owner) contains */
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    /* returns the owner of a specific NFT, identified by it's tokenId*/
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    /* is used to transfer a specific token from the sender(_from) to the receiver(_to)*/
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    /* is used to transfer a specific token from the sender(_from) to the receiver(_to)*/
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    /* is used to allow a certain address to move a specific tokenID */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
    /* is used to allow a certain address to move any tokenID */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    /* returns which address is currently able to move this token. Only one can be active at a time.*/
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
    /* Tells whether an operator is approved by a given owner. */
```

**Events**

```solidity
 event Transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId);
 /* gets emitted upon successfull transfer of a token. Only one unit can ever be transferred at a time*/
 event Approval(address _owner, address _approved, uint256 _tokenId);
 /* gets emitted upon the approval of an operator for a specific tokenId */
 event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);
 /* gets emitted upon the approval of an operator for all tokens of this collection */
```

### **Tables in Dune**

In Dune, we decode all erc721 transfer events from all smart contracts into one table `erc721_blockchain.ERC721_evt_Transfer`.

#### erc721\_blockchain.ERC721**\_evt\_Transfer**

This is the event that gets emitted upon successful transfer of a token within a ERC721 smart contract. This can be triggered by either the `safeTransferFrom` or the `transferFrom` functions.

| from               | string      | the sender of the `ERC721` token                                                       |

| tokenID            | numeric     | The Token ID which uniquely identifies this NFT                                        |

| evt\_index         | numeric     | this logs index position in the block (cumulative amount of logs ordered by execution) |
| evt\_block\_time   | timestamptz | the time at which the block that contains this event log got mined                     |
| evt\_block\_number | int8        | the length of the blockchain                                                           |

#### erc721\_blockchain.ERC721\_evt\_Approval

This is the event that gets emitted upon a successful call of the `approve` function.

| owner              | string                   | the address which gives permission to move this token                                  |
