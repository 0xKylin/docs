title: ETHBerlin Hacker Quick Start
description: Welcome to the Dune API ETHBerlin Hackers! Get started with the Dune API here.

Welcome hackers! We are excited to see what you build with our APIs.

## Getting an API Key
You can reach out to our booth at the conferene, and we will quickly set you up. You can also write to us over api@dune.com and we will provide you an API key.

## Important Links
 - [API Documentation](https://dune.com/docs/api/)
 - [API Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/757637422384283659/1019910980634939433)
 - [API Client (Community Sourced)](https://dune.com/docs/api/quick-start/community-clients/)

## Picking a Programming Language
You can consume our APIs in any language of your choice, using the API reference section in the documentation. We currently have quick start guides for Python and Node JS.

## What to Build
You have access to all the data from most blockchain ecosystems that exist today. There is no limit to what you can build on top of this data.

Here is some inspiration for you to ideate...

### Applications using parameterised queries
Our community champion Boxer has this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ez3VfcfNwvc) where he walks us through creating a [dashboard](https://dune.com/0xBoxer/gas-tracker-dashboard) for personalised metrics for any wallet. With the APIs it is possible to build a much nicer interface for this. And not just this dashboard, any dashboard on Dune, particularly with parameterised queries, can now be an app with some smooth UX.

### New kinds of Interfaces to Blockchain Data
With the API, the data can Flow anywhere. Think Excel/ Google sheets/ Notion Pages, Discord Bots, Telegram Bots, there is no limits.

### Bonus
Ben from our community, gave a talk at DuneCon where he walked us through some use cases where his team is already using the Dune API for some of their tasks.
Here is [a timestamped link to the recording](https://youtu.be/VEvk-iqxXIM?t=404).
