# Tables

Dune enables you to query data on our supported chains at different levels of abstraction.

Here is an overview what is available:

- [Raw data](raw.md): unedicated, raw and encoded blockchain data
- [Decoded data](decoded.md): (**most popular**) view the decoded calls and events made to smart contracts
- [Abstractions, or Spellbooks](abstractions.md): custom tables that are maintained by Dune and our community
- [Community](community.md): partnering with select organisations for off-chain data
- [Prices](prices.md): prices from third party data providers
- [User generated](user-generated.md): construct your own view, function or table inside of our database
