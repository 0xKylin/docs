title: Spells
description: With the help of the community we construct customs tables which cover the entirety of a type of activity on the blockchain called Spells.

!!! note
    Spells are only available in Dune V2. For V1 queries you'll need to use the now-deprecated [Abstractons found here](v1/abstractions/index.md). 

**Spells are custom tables that are built and maintained by Dune and our community.**

These enable you to effortlessly aggregate lots of data with as little friction as possible.

To view available Spells, take a look at our [Spellbook model documentation](https://dune.com/spellbook) and learn how to contribute new spells [here](../spellbook/index.md).

Our Spells are managed via the public [Spellbook GitHub repository](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/index.md). We welcome pull requests!

For our **V1 Engine** (PostgreSQL), abstractions are snippets of SQL executed the data platform. You can check for existing abstractions on [GitHub](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/deprecated-dune-v1-abstractions), and view [documentation](v1/abstractions/index.md) on our most popular abstractions.
