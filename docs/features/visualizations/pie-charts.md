## Configuring your pie chart

![Configuring your pie chart](images/pie-charts-2.png)

### Chart Options

#### Title

* The Title will appear in all instances of this graph prominently at the top
* If left blank the Query name will be the only thing that is left standing

**Show data labels**

* Ticking this box leads to the display of the individual datapoints inside of the graph.
* This only makes sense in cases where you have few datapoints that are spread out far enough from each other to not overlap.

### Result data

Here you can pick the data points that are to be displayed.

You can choose one **x-axis** and one y-axis.

### Pie Options

**Label format**

* This field allows you to define the [tick format](https://docs.dune.com/features/visualizations#tick-formats) of the data labels.
