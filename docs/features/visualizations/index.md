description: Visualizations make your data come alive! Here's what you need to know to make ✨

With your blockchain data gathered and organized via [Queries](../../features/queries/), it's time to add a bit more ✨ with Visualizations.

With Dune, you have a variety of ways to transform your Query data into visual data:

[**Chart visualizations**](charts-graphs.md)

* Bar charts
* Area charts
* Scatter charts
* Line charts
* Pie charts

[**Other visualizations**](other-visualizations.md)

* Counters
* Tables

Combining these in a thoughtful manner allows you to best communicate your data to your audience via [Dashboards](../../features/dashboards.md) and [Embeds](../sharing/embeds.md).

## Creating Visualizations

You can create Visualizations from any Query results in seconds using Dune's Visualization engine.

To get started, click the <span class="fk-btn-2">New Visualization</span> button:

![new visualization click button](images/new-visualization-click-button.gif)

You'll then see a dropdown appear with a list of the available types of Visualization. Select the one you want then click the <span class="fk-btn-1">Add visualization</span> button to create your Visualization:

![select visualization from dropdown](images/select-visualization-from-dropdown.gif)

You can create multiple Visualizations from one Query (to test which works best or reveal different insights) by repeating the steps above:

## Sharing Visualizations

Once you've created a Visualization you're happy with, you can share it with others on a [Dashboard](../dashboards.md) or be embedded on another website using an [Embed](../sharing/embeds.md).

### Adding Visualizations to Dashboards

To add a Visualization to a [Dashboard](../dashboards.md), click the <span class="fk-btn-3">Add to dashboard</span> button:

 1. Click the <span class="fk-btn-3">New dashboard</span> button
 2. Add a name
 3. Click the <span class="fk-btn-1">Save dashboard</span> button
 4. Click the <span class="fk-btn-2">Add</span> button next to your new Dashboard
