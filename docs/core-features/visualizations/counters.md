### Counter options

In this section you can define what kind of data the counter should display.

#### Title

* The Title will appear in all instances of this graph prominently at the top
* If left blank the Query name will be the only thing that is left standing

#### Column

* In this field you can define which column the counter should show.

#### Row

* This field can be used to define which row of the underlying data table you want displayed e.g. row 1
* Usually this requires you to sort or limit your Query results in order for row 1 to show the wanted results.

### Formatting

**Prefix**

* This field allows you to define a prefix for your counter value.
* e.g.: `$`, `€`, `Ξ`, `฿`

**Suffix**

* This field allows you to define a suffix for your counter value.

**Label**

* This field allows you to define a label for your counter value.
* The label will appear beneath the counter value as text.

**Decimals**

* In this field you can choose how many decimals you want displayed for your counter
* This is currently limited to 3 decimal places.
