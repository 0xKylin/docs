Visualizing your query results makes the results accessible and allows you to effectively communicate your findings to your audience.

Dune offers you a variety of different Visualization options:

* bar charts
* area charts
* scatter charts
* line charts
* pie charts
* counters

Combining these in a thoughtful manner allows you to best communicate your data to your audience.

## Creating Visualizations

You can create Visualizations from any query results in seconds using our Visualization engine.

Simply click on the `New Visualization` button and configure the Visualization to your needs.

One query can have multiple Visualizations.
