# Abstractions/Spells in Dune V2

Abstractions are rebranded "spells" to align with our [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) project [spellbook](https://github.com/duneanalytics/abstractions/tree/master/spellbook).&#x20;

In Dune V1, abstractions were used first to define community-generated views and then morphed into a way for the community to define tables.&#x20;

Spellbook is our community data transformation layer that allows our community to create views, tables, and incremental tables and implement tests to validate data quality.&#x20;
