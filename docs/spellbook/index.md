# Spellbook

**Spellbook is a data transformation layer for Dune, built by the community.**

Spells are recipes to build high level tables that support common use cases, like NFT trades. You write them in SQL, wrapped in a Python templating language called Jinja2.

Spellbook automates the build, maintenance and data quality of these tables. Anyone in our community can contribute to our spells, whether that is adding a new exchange or writing an entirely new spell.

!!! note
    Spellbook is available on our Dune V2 Engine. For abstractions on Dune V1 Engine, see [abstractions](/tables/v1/abstractions).
