- Ensure that [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) is installed.

- Install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), this will allow us to create a virtualenv with dbt.

- Set up [git and github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) including authentication.

- Make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the [spellbook repo](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook). Including cloning locally and adding an upstream.

- Review Githubâ€™s [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) on how to make a pull request from a fork.
