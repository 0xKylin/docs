# Wizard Request Program

Over the past 3 years, Dune has become the go-to solution for on-demand crypto analytics. 
How many Holders does BAYC have? Wanna do some whale watching? How is the UST depeg going? How many users are using Uniswap V3 in a day?

Dune has it all and can do it all, but there is still lots of things that are left unexplored. Dune only works because of the countless Wizards out there who surface this data for the greater space. Many of the dashboards and queries you see on Dune today were made out of sheer curiosity and enjoyment, but fundamentally, Wizards should and want to be paid.
Wizards will work for clout, carrots and stars, but they also do like money.

## The solution

Going forward, we will leverage [dework.xyz](https://www.dework.xyz) to manage and operate a bounty program 
Dework describes itself as a “web3 native trello with payments and credentialing. What that exactly means, you can find out from Lonis, co-founder of dework, in this video:

Dework offers us to write out tasks on our own [board](https://app.dework.xyz/dune/board) and allows other organisations to seamlessly connect with Dune Wizards by simply specifying “Dune Analytics” as Skill. All open tasks that have the Dune Analytics Skill attached will appear in the [Dune hub](https://app.dework.xyz/hubs/dune), allowing for tasks to be easily found by our Wizard Community.


## For projects looking for Wizards

**If you are an organisation in need of web3 analytics, it’s now easier than ever before to connect with Dune Wizards!**

1. **Create a organisation**

	If you don’t have a Dework organisation yet, the first step is creating one. For a basic setup, we recommend setting up at least a description, an icon and link to your socials so Wizards know who they are working with. In order to be able attach a monetary reward to your task, you also need to connect a payment method to the space that you are hosting the bounty in.
    
2. **Define tasks**

     After completing the initial setup, you can start creating tasks for anything really, but in our case, we want to define tasks with the "Dune Analytics" Skill. Once you have created a task, the task will be 1) in your board and 2) in the Dune hub. From there on out, people can find your open task and apply. It helps to also raise awarness for tasks in your Discord/ Socials. Read more about proper task configuration here.

3.  **Choose an applicant**

    If you have defined a task that needs to be assigned to someone, you will get notifications within Dework and can vet the contributor using their work history, github profile and any other attached information on their profile. It is strongly recommended to spend some effort looking at the contributor to have a smooth bounty process.

4.  **Review the work**

    Once the Wizard you have chosen has submitted their work for review, you can start reviewing the completed task. If it is satisfactory, you can mark the task as done and initiate the payment process.

5.  **Pay your contributor**

    Dework integrates with Metamask, Gnosis Safes, Utopia Labs and even phantom wallet for Solana based payments. You can choose whatever works best for you here.





## For Wizards looking for :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag:

If you are a Wizard or an aspiring Wizard, join the Dune Analytics organisation on Dework and start looking for tasks on our [board](https://app.dework.xyz/dune/board) or on the [Dune hub](https://app.dework.xyz/hubs/dune). Joining our organisation is highly recommended so other organisation on Dework can see the roles we have assigned to you. Make sure to properly define your profile with relevant links to socials, github and dune profile so organisations trying to assess your skills can make sure to judge you properly.


### FAQs about the program

#### I need a lot of data, how many requests should I post?

Think of every request as a dashboard. If you’d like to see all of your information in just one dashboard, then just one request. If, on the other hand, you’d like to see three different dashboards we recommend you create three requests. Creating three requests doesn’t necessarily mean working with three different analysts, that will be up to you to decide.

#### I’m an analyst. How do I enroll?

For the moment the only thing you need to do is join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/dunecom), go to our “freelancer-listing” channel and click on the flying dollar bill emoji there, this way you’ll get notified when new requests arrive. Oh and you should definitely follow the [bounty bot](https://twitter.com/Dune_Bounties) on Twitter.

#### I want to create a requests but I don’t know how much should I pay/offer for it

Well, that really depends on how much work/complexity your request entails but to the extent that you can, we encourage you to be generous. If you ain’t sure you can always ask on our Discord!

#### Does Dune take a cut?

No we don’t. In fact, Dune does not take part in closing the deal or following up over time, this is strictly between the wizard and the project.
