# Does Dune have an API?

**Dune does have an API!**

It's currently in private beta with a closed set of users, but will be publicly available in November!

If you don't have API access, [paid plan users](https://dune.com/pricing) can export results as CSV and anyone can embed Dune charts on their page for free by clicking "[Embed](../../features/sharing/embeds.md)" on any query Visualization.
