# Spellbook Workshop

I hope you’re looking forward to the Spellbook workshop at Dunecon!

There’s a few prerequisites that will help make this workshop run smoothly. We ask that if attendees would like to follow along they make sure they have the following set up before we begin.

**Prerequisites:**

1. Have [Python 3.9](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) installed on your computer.&#x20;
2. Install an IDE to edit your code. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a nice free one.&#x20;
3. Ensure that [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) is installed.&#x20;
4. Install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), this will allow us to create a virtualenv with dbt.&#x20;
5. Set up [git and github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) including authentication.&#x20;
6. Make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the [spellbook repo](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook). Including cloning locally and adding an upstream.&#x20;
7. Review Github’s [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) on how to make a pull request from a fork.&#x20;
